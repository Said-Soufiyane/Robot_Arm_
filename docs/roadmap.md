## Roadmap (next steps)
- Bring-up Phase
  - Verify each motor wiring (coil pairs) + one driver at a time.
  - Validate UART comms (IFCNT changes), then lock current settings per motor.
  - Do a holding torque “breakaway” test and record results.
  - Do a moving torque test with acceleration (no instant speed jumps).
- Multi-axis Phase
  - Move to ESP32 controller.
  - Decide: shared UART bus vs per-driver UART (likely shared).
  - Build a harness: proper connectors, strain relief, common ground, fusing.
  - Implement homing strategy (limit switches or hardstops + repeatability tests).
- Mechanical Phase
  - Finish gearbox stackups once gearboxes arrive.
  - Finalize shaft/rod lengths from real parts + CAD, then cut/deburr.
  - Assemble one joint fully and test backlash, stiffness, and thermal behavior.
- Software Phase
  - Motion planner basics: acceleration ramps, velocity limits, soft limits.
  - Kinematics later (after mechanics stable): FK/IK for 6-axis.
- Documentation Phase (continuous)
  - Keep LOG.md updated with tests, failures, fixes.
  - Add photos/videos to media/ and link from log.
  - Write “Lessons Learned” and “Design Rationale” for final report.
